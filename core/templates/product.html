          <h3>Concept</h3>
          <p>There are multiple facets to the decision on technology that this product would utilize, but weâ€™re focusing on making it as convenient as possible to ensure effectiveness of such a solution. A minimalistic and comfortable wearable device that provides the data used to determine if the person of interest is safe. In case of detection of any abnormalities from the daily routine, the caregiver would be notified. Development of this system will involve a smart use of machine learning to establish habit patterns and detect changes that could make it dangerous. </p>
